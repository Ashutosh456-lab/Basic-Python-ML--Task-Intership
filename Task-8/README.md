# TASK- Next Word Prediction using Tensorflow and Keras

Using Tensorflow and Keras library train a RNN, to predict the next word.

Most of the keyboards in smartphones give next word prediction features; google also uses next word prediction based on our browsing history.
So a preloaded data is also stored in the keyboard function of our smartphones to predict the next word correctly. In this article,
I will train a Deep Learning model for next word prediction using Python. I will use the Tensorflow and Keras library in Python for next word prediction model.
